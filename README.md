# Abstract
There are various way to accumulate wealth over time and the method each individual uses may depend on their risk level. This paper focuses on further investigating some of the aspects written in a analysis paper, 'Rich Pickings? Risk, Return and Skill in Household Wealth', which investigates the risk and returns of household wealth in Sweden. The data used in the original paper is being used in this paper to provide further analysis of the dataset. We visualise the data using tables and graphs, and observe a difference in distribution of wealth of households at each wealth level. The findings can be implemented as a benchmark for individuals who seek to accumulate wealth over time.
